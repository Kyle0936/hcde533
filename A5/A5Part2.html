            Recap: this is how the lamp looks like last week: <br />
            <img src="lamp_light.jpeg"></a> <br />


            To finish the lamp from last week, I tried to print a cover for the lamp. I used "Sweep1" to produce a
            "fire-shaped" cover. The reason that I could not create a more complicated "fire" is that the hole I left
            last week was not big enough and there was a sword standing besides the hole. When trying to make the cover
            fit on the base, I started with adding 4 "legs" under the "fire-shaped" cover. However, after several failed
            test prints, I noticed that the legs could be broken easily as the thickness limited by the space left in
            the hole was not good enough. As a result, I made the cover to exactly fit with the light bulb's size, which
            equals to the size of the hole, so that the cover could fit and sit on the base. <br /><br />

            How it looks like: sorry for the bad color match. The "golden" filament I purchased was terribly wrapped and
            made my 3d printing stuck and failed for 3 times. <br />

            <h3>Part B</h3>

            I was thinking to have a wooden fish for my final project.<br />

            I used BooleanSplit to cut an ellipsoid and got the shape of the woodenfish. Then I cut it in half and put each of them onto a surface. Then I added the keys and the pouring hole as raised objects. <br /><br />

            Here's how it looks like after 3d printed for 10 hours:
