            <h3>Part A</h3>

            I tried to find models related to my fav video game "Souls series" on Thingiverse and I found <a
                href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2401490/">this "thing"</a> by <a
                href="https://www.thingiverse.com/classygoat/designs">ClassyGoat</a>. The original object is a bonfire,
            which is an iconic object in the souls series. <br /><br />

            Bonfire in Dark Souls: <br />
            <img src="ds3.jpg"></a><br />

            The "thing" contains two separated stl files for the bonfire pit and the fire. The fire is a closed mesh
            while the pit is a block of 9 closed meshes. I exploded the block first and then used "MeshBooleanUnion" to
            combine all of the closed meshes and ended up with a single closed mesh. I also used "ReduceMesh" to speed
            up the process.<br />

            <h3>Part B</h3>

            I started with measuring the latern innereds. <br />
            <img src="measure.jpeg"></a> <br />

            I decided to keep using the bonfire model I donwloaded and modified it to make it fit with the innereds. I
            used "MeshBoolenDifference" multiple times to make big holes that can fit with the innereds as well as the
            light bulb. I tested with printing the base of the lamp but it failed to fit with the innereds firmly.
            <br />

            I added two snap joints to make sure the innereds can fit firmly. I tested with printing the joints by
            themselves again but the initial print failed and stuck in the holes of the innereds. <br />
            <img src="fail.jpeg"></a><br />

            I modified the snap joints again and started printing the whole base, and this is how it looks like after
            12-hours of printing: <br /> <br />
