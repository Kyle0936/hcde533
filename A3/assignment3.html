            As both my roommate @Kefeng Wang, our friend @Sherry Wang, and I are in this same class, we shared the 3d
            printer and we assembled it together. It took us around 2 hours to finish assembling it. We didn't get to
            the step to adjust the
            extruder's eccentric nuts because it does not wiggle. We checked for loose screws but forgot the adjust
            build plate level until later.

            We tried to adjust the bed leveling using the gcode files provided but we soon encountered the problem that
            the top-left adjustment knob cannot level up any more while the nuzzle is still far away from the plate.
            Then we were inspired by @Andy Moon, who mentioned that he encountered a similar problem and he solved it by
            adjusting the z-bedding level. We followed his suggestion and successfully solved the issue.

            Then I started 3D printing by building models in Rhino and slicing those stl files with different settings
            in Cura. I used those gcode files generated by Cura to print them out in the 3d printer. Here are what all
            those 3d models look like and how I measure them:

            Standard quality cube:

            Super quality cube:

            Concentric top/bottom cube:

            Single extrusion wall tube:

            Double extrusion wall tube:

            0.001mm tolerance cylinder:

            Special cylinder:

            Side cylinder:

            Nested Objects:
