            I'm inspired by the a popular trend in China where people use digital wooden fish on mobile devices to try
            to improve their mental health. There have been mobile apps developed for this purpose, such as <a
                href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wooden-fish/id1522144157">this one</a>. The original wooden fish is
            a type of instrument and is used to increase one's merit in buddhism while nowadays some young people in
            China online treat it as something to calm their minds down to peace during this difficult time. I was
            thinking to make a physical version for myself with the similar purpose. <br /><br />

            <img src="inspired.jpg"></a> <br />
            I found this video where this person made a physical version of an automated wooden fish that can knock by
            itself with different speeds. I was inspired by the design of how to control the movement of the wooden fish
            and I decided to design a manual version. Here's the concept sketch: <br /><br />

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <h4>1. Casting (DONE in Assignment6)</h4>
            I used Rhino to build the molds for the woodenfish's molds first. I used commands mainly around polysurfaces
            instead of meshes, such as BooleanDifference, mainly because the troubles brought by involving meshes too
            early in the stage. Then I mixed around 180g in total of Oomoo 30 to get the silicone mold for the
            woodenfish. As the final step, I mixed 60g of hydrostone and 20g of water and pour into the silicone mold to
            cast the "hydrostone-fish". <br /><br />
            <img src="moldformold.jpg"></a> <br />
            <img src="woodenfish_mold.jpg"></a> <br />

            <h4>2. CAD Modelling</h4>
            <img src="CAD_new.jpeg" /><br />
            Here are all the parts that I ended up building models and 3d printing: <br /><br />
            <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
                <li class="list-group-item">Handler (green)</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Drum (green)</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Lever (green)</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Square Stick (green)</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Pentagon Stick (green)</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Holders (red)</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">2 pieces of the box (blue)</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Mold for woodenfish's mold (purple)</li>
            </ul>
            <br />

            I started with calculating the size of the box based on the casted bell and the size of the drum required to
            hit it. The lever needs to make the drum drop from 3 cm above to hit the bell to make sounds. As a result,
            the distance between the stick to fix the drum and the lever is 2cm. The length of the drum is 10cm. <br />
            <img src="calculate.jpeg" /><br />

            Based on the calculation, I was able to figure out the size of the box that would be laser cutted out of 2D
            design. I followed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EUG-dx2lug">this guide</a> to build a
            grasshopper script that can generate 4 pieces of jagged boards that implemented the interference fits to
            build a box. After those 4 pieces were baked, I made the fifth piece based on them and also made several
            holes on them where I could use sticks to fix the drum and the lever later. <br />
            <img src="box.png" /><br />

            For other parts of system, I started with small parts to test print and iterated the models for 3d printing
            multiple times. The initial idea was to have the handler and the lever fit closely with the pentagon stick
            while have the drum hanging by the square stick loosely. Because of the inaccuracy of the 3d printing, I
            ended up adjusted multiple times to have the fitted sizes. However, the fixation was not strong enough to
            let me keep the lever rolling with the handler. As a result, I added 4 more pentagon-shaped "holders" to
            keep them fit with the stick and the box closely and 2 more square-shaped "holders" to keep the drum inside
            the center of the box. <br /><br />

            <h4>3. Laser cutting</h4>
            I had the 5 pieces of the box laser cutted using acrylic borads with 6.35 mm thickness. However, because of
            the miscalculation for two out of five pieces, the box cannot get pressed and fit closely. I ended up with
            redesigned the two pieces and had them 3d printed which would be shown later. <br /><br />

            <h4>4. 3D printing</h4>
            <img src="3dsystem.jpeg" /><br />
            Based on the test prints, I adjusted models severl times and had all required pieces of the system 3d
            printed, together with additional 2 pieces of the box. <br /><br />

            <h4>5. Assembling</h4>
            With all the pieces ready, I started assembling them together as shown in the pictures: <br /><br />
