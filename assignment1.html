            I started with recalling a box I made previously with a laser cutter when I was in high school. I barely
            remembered I used protrudes and sunkens at the edges to make sure those 6 pieces can be put together and
            pressed to build a box. So I started with thinking about using protrudes and sunkens to make sure I can at
            least use those 30 pieces to build several "boxes".
            <br /><br />

            Then, I thought about how to make them "ubiquitous" so that I could have various ways to put them together
            later. I would like to add an additional way to put pieces together, so I measured the thickness of the
            cardboard I would use later to laser cut. It turned out to be 3mm. Then I changed the widths of all the
            sunkens and protrudes to 3mm, so that I can press and fit two pieces with a 90 degree of rotation later.

            This is how the 32 pieces look like in Rhino:

            I turned the 3d models into 2d graphs in Illustrator in order to prepare them for laser cutting. In order to
            save more space while cutting, I changed the layouts so that protrudes and sunkens of all pieces are matched
            together to reduce the paddings between pieces. This is how it looks like in Illustrator before being
            printed.
