            I started with the idea to make a box using 5 flat pieces. Then I brainstormed about different types of
            joints to put two pieces together. I did some research online about what types of joints can be used and I
            was motivated by snap joints mentioned in <a
                href="https://all3dp.com/2/3d-printing-snap-fit-design-simply-explained/">this article</a>.  <br /><br />

            I built the snap joint first in Rhino for test prints.  <br /><br />

            Snap joints in Rhino:  <br />
            <img src="3d_test_piece.jpg"></a><br />

            I experienced issues when printing those small pieces and failed several times to make joints work as
            expected. I noticed that the bottom layer expanded larger than expected. I tried several times and adjusted
            the babystep in 3d printer to made a successful pair printed.  <br /><br />

            Failed prints:  <br />

            Successful print:  <br />
            <img src="success1.jpg"></a>

            With the working 3d model for the snap joints, I started building the whole piece. I tested several
            iterations and the accuracy issues together with adhesion issues of 3d printing made so much troubles for
            me. After several iterations, I changed the design to have only 1 snap joint on each side of a piece to
            avoid accuracy issues as many as possible.  <br />  <br />

            Iterations of 3d modelings for flat pieces:  <br /> 
            <img src="3d_test_all.jpg"></a>  <br />

            Failed prints related to adhesion issues: <br /> 
            <img src="fail1.jpg"></a>
            <img src="fail2.jpg"></a> <br />

            Iterations of 3d prints for flat pieces: <br />
            <img src="test_whole.jpg"></a>

            After all, I finalized my design with 3.4 mm as the thickness of the flat piece in rhino and 3 mm as the
            thickness of the actual printed model. I also added another additional 0.4 mm for the snap joints to printed
            correctly. <br />  <br />

            Final Rhino design: <br />

            Successful printed flat pieces: <br />
            <img src="success2.jpg"></a> <br />

            After the successful prints of two flat pieces, I printed all 5 pieces to put together and form the box. <br />
