            <h3>Concept</h3>

            <img src="init.jpg"></a> <br />
            I'm inspired by the a popular trend in China where people use digital wooden fish on mobile devices to try
            to improve their mental health. There have been mobile apps developed for this purpose. such as <a
                href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wooden-fish/id1522144157">this one</a>. The original wooden fish is
            a type of instrument and is used to increase one's merit in buddhism while nowadays some young people in
            China online treat it as something to calm their minds down to peace during this difficult time. I was
            thinking to make a physical version for myself with the similar purpose. <br /><br />

            <img src="inspired.jpg"></a> <br />
            I found this video where this person made a physical version of an automated wooden fish that can knock by
            itself with different speeds. I was inspired by the design of how to control the movement of the wooden fish
            and I decided to design a manual version. Here's the concept sketch: <br /><br />
            <img src="concept.jpg"></a> <br /> <br />

            <h3>Tasks</h3>
            <h4>Casting (DONE in Assignment6)</h4>
            I built two molds for the two silicon molds and used the hydrostone to cast the wooden fish from my silicon
            molds. <br /><br />
            <img src="moldformold.jpg"></a> <br />
            <img src="woodenfish_mold.jpg"></a> <br />

            <h4>CAD Modelling & 3d printing</h4>
            Here are all the parts that I need to build models for and to be 3d printed: <br /><br />
            <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
                <li class="list-group-item">Handle</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Drum</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Lever</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Stick</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Holders that can fix the handle, the drum, and the lever on the stick \n
                    Only necessary if they cannot fit with the stick by themselves</li>
            </ul>
            <br />

            I also need to do test prints to make sure they can fit with each other correctly. <br /><br />


            <h4>Grasshopper & Laser Cutting</h4>
            I also need to build models for 5 pieces of a box that will be laser cutted. Those five pieces need to have
            "jagged" joints which can be easily adjusted by using the parmetric design.<br /><br />
