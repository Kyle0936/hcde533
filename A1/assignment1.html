            I started with recalling a box I made previously with a laser cutter when I was in high school. I barely
            remembered I used protrudes and sunkens at the edges to make sure those 6 pieces can be put together and
            pressed to build a box. So I started with thinking about using protrudes and sunkens to make sure I can at
            least use those 32 pieces to build several "boxes".
            <br /><br />

            Then, I thought about how to make them "ubiquitous" so that I could have various ways to put them together
            later. I would like to add an additional way to put pieces together, so I measured the thickness of the
            cardboard I would use later to laser cut. It turned out to be 3mm. Then I changed the widths of all the
            sunkens and protrudes to 3mm, so that I can press and fit two pieces with a 90 degree of rotation later.

            This is how the 32 pieces look like in Rhino:

            I turned the 3d models into 2d graphs in Illustrator in order to prepare them for laser cutting. In order to
            save more space while cutting, I changed the layouts so that protrudes and sunkens of all pieces are matched
            together to reduce the paddings between pieces. This is how it looks like in Illustrator before being
            printed.

            Thanks to staff members at the Mill Makerspace, I was able to quickly set up the laser cut and test cut
            several times. I noticed there was an issue with the size of the 2d graphs in Illustrator. The first several
            pieces I cut were not ablt to firmly fit together. Even though the widths of sunkens and protrudes were
            set to 3mm ahead to match the thickness of the cardboard I used, the material itself was a bit soft and made
            it difficult to fit firmly. As a result, I adjusted the widths in the 2d graphs to a bit smaller than 3mm.

            Here's how the cutting process looks like:

            Then, I tried to assemble a model with these 32 pieces. I started with making opened boxes with 5 pieces.
            Because of the flexbility of each piece, I could also assemble chains of pieces. As a result, I decided to
            build a model of a bridge by using 4 opened boxes as piers and two chains as beams. Here's how it looks
            like:
