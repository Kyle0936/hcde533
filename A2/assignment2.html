            This week, I tried to make the parameterized version of A1. Here's the overview of the grasshopper
            definition.

            <img src="gh.png"></a>

            At the very beginning of the definition, users can adapt the parameters based on the required size of pieces
            as well as the thickness of cardboards that will be used to laser cut. Here's how the beginning looks like:

            <img src="start.png"></a>

            Here's the whole progress broken down into several steps: <br/>

            Step1: <img src="Group 1.png"></a>

            Step2: <img src="Group 2.png"></a>

            Step3: <img src="Group 3.png"></a>

            Step4: <img src="Group 4.png"></a>

            Step5: <img src="Group 5.png"></a>

            At the end of the definition, users can change the number of pieces that will be generated by selecting
            vertical and horizontal numbers using those two number sliders. Here's how the end looks like:

            <img src="end.png"></a>

            For the laser cut, I used the cardboard with 3mm as the thickness again and I adjusted the number slider in
            the gh definition to 2.95, which is slightly smaller than 3, as the cut last week was not able to fit with
            each other firm enough.

            This time, I tried to assemble several boxes together and here's how the model looks like:
